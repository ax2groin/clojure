# Little Clojurer

This is code I write in Clojure, converting *The Little LISPer* code. (I was
working from a friend's copy of the original book.) The latest version of the
book is [The Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer).

I highly recommend the book for people new to recursion or LISP. I also
recommend working through the book in a Scheme dialect. If you are not familiar
with Clojure, the differences between Scheme and Clojure can be a bit confusing.
