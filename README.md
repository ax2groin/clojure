# Clojure Hodge Podge

This repository is a dumping ground for Clojure code of all kinds. Much of it is
snippets associated with learning and practice exercises.

## Spoiler Alert

Note that this repository does include the answers to problems at different
sites, such a [Project
Euler](https://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems) and
[Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/clojure/about). If you are actively
working on problems there, avoid my answers until you've solved them yourself.
